### Hi there 👋

My name is Chuanyi(中文互联网请叫我二牛), a backend software engineer in Nanjing. Java is used most of the time in my work. I write other languages, like python, javascript, and so forth. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Garmin App developing. I highly recommend my first app [JumpJump](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/92273c4b-9b53-4a8e-86a9-e5235af2505c)
- 🌱 Running is always on my daily schedule. I love marathon. So far, I have participated in more than 10 marathons. My personal best record is 3:30:15, created in 2020 Guangzhou Marathon on 13 Dec. OFC, as most runners dream about, I want to finish the six major marathons in the world.

### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chuanyi, a backend software engineer in Nanjing. I use java for most of my work. I write other programming languages as well, like python, javascript, and so forth. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Garmin App developing in my spare time. If you like Jumping rope and own a Garmin watch, I highly recommend my first app [JumpJump](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/dc6ceca8-6ec6-49f2-b711-4ebc0d347177)
- ðŸŒ± Running is always on my daily schedule. So far, I have participated in more than 10 marathons. My personal best record is 3:30:15, created in 2020 Guangzhou Marathon on 13 Dec. OFC, as most runners dream about, I want to finish the six major marathons in the world.
